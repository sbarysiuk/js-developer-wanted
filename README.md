PandaDoc is a web and mobile application which revolutionizes how people work with business documents. Think about it as of Google Docs with an electronic signing, integration with external systems, a document analytic and other cool features. 

We're looking for a JavaScript ninja to help us with our web app. Your daily routine will look like: 
- Working on an application architecture
- Developing reusable components
- Developing functional parts of the system
- Doing code reviews
- Writing functional tests
- and more...

Our web app is a single page application written in Angular 1 (will be porting to React) which connects to REST services on a backend. There are may challenges to tackle: modular application design, working on a rich text editor in a browser, a collaborative editing, an offline support and application performance. UI/UX is one of the key elements as well.

We're a small team (I would even say a family) located in Minsk, Belarus. This is our own product. It means there is no customer how is telling what to do, we choose what to do next on our own.

Who we're looking for: a person with
- Good JS experience (3+ years) and deep understand of all basics
- Experience with single page JS apps
- Strong knowledge of HTML/CSS
- Understanding of general patterns in web apps
- Experience with one of frameworks (Angular, React(preferable), Backbone or Ember)
- Knowledge any of those is a big plus: Gulp, ES6 & ES2015, TypeScript (and/or Babel), Webpack/Browserify
